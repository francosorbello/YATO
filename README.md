# YATO: Yet Another TODO list

YATO is a TODO list app, with the unique twist that information is presented in a graph, in form of nodes.

YATO presents 3 types of nodes:

- Folders: folders can contain other types of nodes, including (sub)folders.
- Comments: comments allow the user to add any notes desired
- Tasks: tasks are a list of TODOs an user can create
